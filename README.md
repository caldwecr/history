An application for storing human knowledge, media, thoughts, anecdotes, and experiences in a distributed manner that cannot be repudiated.

# Purpose

Establish an interstellar, distributed repository of knowledge that is mono-directionally time verifiable (the ability
to prove that some piece of knowledge, art, or achievement occurred before a point in time).

It is my expectation that any future environs in which humans or our computers are present will include at least
one copy of the block chain data structure. Ideally each of these environs will also have the ability to be continually
updated by radio transmissions and be able to confirm, create, and receive transactions.

- Systematically select which information is most important or urgently needed
- Encode the selected information for storage in the block chain
- Collect transaction fee expenses via the information selection / prioritization process
- Have the information confirmed in the block chain
- See that all future human space missions include a copy of the latest block chain on-board
- Establish new and / or leverage existing satellite networks and systems to enable an on going relay of the block chain
 to and from all long term human space infrastructures as well as the nearest 314 stars
- Ensure that the means to decode the encoded information always precedes the encoded information in the block chain

In several cases algorithms already exist for transcoding different types of information into a format suitable for
storage in and extraction from the block chain.

I plan to use a staged process for achieving these goals.

# Stage 1: historical information

## Stage 1: objectives

### Creation of transcoding services for historical media

- [ ] human writings (single-byte and multi-byte support)
- [ ] sheet music
- [ ] low resolution, black and white, two dimensional images

### Data format creation

- [ ] document strictly semantically versioned data formats for each of the three stage 1 media types
- [ ] encode the stage 1 data formats in the block chain using the previously existing cryptografitti.info algorithm
- [ ] encode the stage 1 data formats using the new human writings data format
- [ ] persist legacy encoding version of the stage 1 data formats in the block chain
- [ ] persist stage 1 data encoding version of the stage 1 data formats in the block chain

### Encoding and storage of preselected information

- [ ] Hamlet by W.S.
- [ ] Beethoven's 5th symphony
- [ ] Map of Earth
- [ ] Map of our solar system
- [ ] Drawings of Leonardo da Vinci

# Approach

Micro-services. More info TBD.
